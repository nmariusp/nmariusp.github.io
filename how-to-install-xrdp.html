# Glossary
RDP is the Remote Desktop Protocol. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol

Operating system (OS).

# RDP features

* Resizing the RDP client window, changes the resolution of the RDP server.
* Copy/paste of text and maybe even files.
* YouTube playback with almost acceptable speed and with sound.
* The speed is so good, that I do most of my work via an RDP connection. Everything is snappy, even using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

# Windows

## Server
On Windows you can enable the RDP server. E.g. right click on Windows Start Menu > System > Rename this PC (advanced) > tab "Remote" > Remote Desktop groupbox > enable "Allow remote connections to this computer". On Windows Server without full GUI experience > sconfig.cmd.

## Client
Open the app Remote Desktop connection.
Or install another RDP client e.g. rdcman https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol 

I prefer rdcman because I need the RDP client to have a window titlebar and window border, I can hide the menu, and after I resize the window, if I select to reconnect, the RDP server's resolution will be changed correctly.


# Linux and FreeBSD

## Server

If you cannot make your X server work correctly, e.g. small resolution. An alternative is to install an RDP server and to connect to this computer from another computer using an RDP client.

Note: on the RDP server, you should log out if you use X11 and you are connected via the computer's keyboard and mouse (aka Ctrl+Alt+F1, aka one of the 8 virtual consoles). Before connecting using an RDP client.

## Kubuntu 22.10

<pre>
sudo apt install xrdp xorgxrdp
</pre>

## EndeavourOS with KDE Plasma installed from the OS installer

<pre>
# As per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xrdp
yay xrdp
yay xorgxrdp

systemctl enable --now xrdp

cat /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
# Should say:
allowed_users = anybody

cat ~/.xinitrc
# Should say:
export DESKTOP_SESSION=plasma
/usr/lib/plasma-dbus-run-session-if-needed startplasma-x11
</pre>

## Client
Install from your OS binary packages `freerdp`.

Run:
<pre>
xfreerdp --help
</pre>

Note down any of the command line parameters that you might need.

Use a command line like:
<pre>
xfreerdp /u:admin /w:1920 /h:1080 /v:192.168.122.168 /video /rfx /network:lan /gfx /dynamic-resolution /bpp:32 /sound:sys:pulse
</pre>

You can resize the window and the resolution of the RDP server will change correctly.

Other interesting command line parameters:
<pre>
connection.rdp
/p:Pwd123!
+auto-reconnect
+drives
/drive:home,/home/user
</pre>
