# How to install xrdp, the RDP server

# Glossary
RDP is the Remote Desktop Protocol. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol

OS means operating system.

# RDP features

* Resizing the RDP client window, changes the resolution of the RDP server. The Microsoft Windows RDP server does not support this feature.
* Copy/paste of text and maybe even files.
* YouTube playback with almost acceptable speed and with sound.
* The speed is so good, that I do most of my work via an RDP connection. Everything is snappy, even using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

# Windows

## Server
On Windows you can enable the RDP server. E.g. right click on Windows Start Menu > System > Rename this PC (advanced) > tab "Remote" > Remote Desktop groupbox > enable "Allow remote connections to this computer". On Windows Server without full GUI experience > sconfig.cmd.

## Client
Open the app Remote Desktop connection.
Or install another RDP client e.g. rdcman https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol 

I prefer rdcman because I need the RDP client to have a window titlebar and window border, I can hide the menu, and after I resize the window, if I select to reconnect, the RDP server's resolution will be changed correctly.


# Linux and FreeBSD

## Server

If you cannot make your X server work correctly, e.g. small resolution. An alternative is to install an RDP server and to connect to this computer from another computer using an RDP client.

Note: on the RDP server, you should log out if you use X11 and you are connected via the computer's keyboard and mouse (aka Ctrl+Alt+F1, aka one of the 8 virtual consoles). Before connecting using an RDP client.

## Kubuntu 22.10

<pre>
sudo apt install xrdp xorgxrdp
</pre>

## EndeavourOS with KDE Plasma installed from the OS installer, Arch Linux installed using archinstall with the option "desktop, kde" from the OS installer

If yay is not installed, such as in Arch Linux, install yay from AUR https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository :
<pre>
pacman -S base-devel
mkdir -p ~/work/aur ; cd ~/work/aur
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg
sudo pacman -U yay*.pkg.tar.zst # E.g. yay-11.3.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
</pre>

Then:
<pre>
# As per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xrdp
yay xrdp
yay xorgxrdp

systemctl enable --now xrdp

cat /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
# Should say:
allowed_users = anybody

cat ~/.xinitrc
# Should say:
export DESKTOP_SESSION=plasma
/usr/lib/plasma-dbus-run-session-if-needed startplasma-x11
</pre>

## Client
Install from your OS the binary package `freerdp`.

Run:
<pre>
xfreerdp --help
</pre>

Note down any of the command line parameters that you might need.

Use a command line like:
<pre>
xfreerdp /u:admin /w:1920 /h:1080 /v:192.168.122.168 /video /rfx /network:lan /gfx /dynamic-resolution /bpp:32 /sound:sys:pulse
</pre>

You can resize the window and the resolution of the RDP server will change correctly.

Other interesting command line parameters:
<pre>
connection.rdp
/p:Pwd123!
+auto-reconnect
+drives
/drive:home,/home/user
</pre>
