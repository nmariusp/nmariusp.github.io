# Ubuntu how to uninstall snap completely

Screen recording

This Linux OS is Kubuntu 23.10.

    $ command line to be run as a Linux user that can use sudo and that is not "root"
    # command line to be run as the Linux user root

In order to become the user root:

    $ sudo su

In order stop being the user root and return to being the other Linux user

    # exit

Unpin the Mozilla Firefox icon from the KDE Plasma panel, i.e. "Icons-only Task Manager".

    $ apt-cache rdepends snapd
    ...
    firefox
    chromium-browser

The only deb packages in Ubuntu that just install the equivalent snap package are the two above.
Instead of <code>chromium-browser</code> you can install the official Google Chrome.
Instead of <code>firefox</code> you can install the official Mozilla Firefox from mozilla.org or
you can use the Ubuntu PPA "mozillateam". I'll use the Ubuntu PPA "mozillateam".

In order to not be without a web browser as we uninstall Mozilla Firefox snap.

    $ sudo apt install falkon

Start the falkon web browser. Search google:
