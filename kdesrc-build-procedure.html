# kdesrc-build procedure

External resources https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development and https://community.kde.org/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Get_Involved%2Fdevelopment&namespace=0

If you want to build the latest KDE source code from git, you want to use kdesrc-build.

# Short version of installing (setting up) kdesrc-build for Qt5 (kf5-qt5) and Qt6 (kf6-qt6)

This will allow you to read from the KDE git repositories, i.e. to build software. In order to write to the KDE git repositories additional steps are required.

You only need to set up kdesrc-build once. You can use the resulting kdesrc-build installation for months.

Steps:

`Step 1.` Use a Linux operating system (OS) that is better supported by kdesrc-build. I.e. a Linux OS for which "kdesrc-build --initial-setup" has support and a Linux OS that uses the KDE Plasma desktop and has new packages. Alphabetic list of such Linux OSes: Arch, latest Fedora KDE Spin, KDE neon, latest Kubuntu, openSUSE Tumbleweed.

If you cannot run the Linux OS on a hardware computer, use a Virtual Machine (VM).

Minimum hardware requirements: 300 GB SSD, 6 GB RAM, 4 CPU threads or virtual CPUs (vCPUs). Recommended 10 GB RAM, 8 CPU threads.

The command line instructions might be specific for different families of Linux OSes. The families of Linux OSes are: Debian (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE neon), Arch (Manjaro, EndeavourOS). When we provide a command line for Debian, that command line is valid for the entire Debian family of Linux OSes.

Please make sure the `sudo` command works correctly in your Linux OS installation.

`Step 2.`

Arch: <pre>sudo pacman -S git</pre>
Debian: <pre>sudo apt update && sudo apt install git</pre>
Fedora: <pre>sudo dnf install git perl</pre>
openSUSE: <pre>sudo zypper install git</pre>

`Step 3.`

<pre>
# Make a backup:
mv ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc~bak
mv ~/kde ~/kde~bak

# kdesrc-build kf5-qt5
mv ~/kde5 ~/kde5~bak

mkdir -p ~/kde5/src
cd ~/kde5/src/
git clone https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build.git
cd kdesrc-build

./kdesrc-build --initial-setup
# Press enter when asked "Update your ~/.bashrc? (y/N)".
mv ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc .
# Edit the file ~/kde5/src/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-buildrc:
# A. replace "/home/username/kde5/src/kdesrc-build/" with "".
# TODO: sed -i

# B. replace "~/kde/" with "~/kde5/".
# TODO: sed -i

# git ignore the file ~/kde5/src/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-buildrc
echo kdesrc-buildrc >> .git/info/exclude

# The same for kdesrc-build kf6-qt6
cd
mv ~/kde6 ~/kde6~bak
cp -r ~/kde5 ~/kde6
cd ~/kde6/src/kdesrc-build

# Edit the file ~/kde6/src/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-buildrc and replace "5" with "6".
# sed -i 's/5/6/g' kdesrc-buildrc
</pre>

Append to ~/kde6/src/kdesrc-buildrc

<pre>
options plasma-integration
    cmake-options -DBUILD_WITH_QT6=ON -DBUILD_QT5=OFF
end options

options breeze
    cmake-options -DBUILD_WITH_QT6=ON -DBUILD_QT5=OFF
end options
</pre>

`Step 4.` Install enough binary packages from your Linux OS such that you can build KDE Frameworks 5 and KDE Frameworks 6 using kdesrc-build.

Arch: <pre></pre>

Debian: <pre>sudo apt install qt6-tools-dev qt6-declarative-dev libqt6core5compat6-dev qt6-wayland qt6-wayland-dev qt6-wayland-dev-tools qt6-base-private-dev libqt6svg6-dev libqt6opengl6-dev libqt6shadertools6-dev doxygen xsltproc xmlto texinfo libcanberra-dev
sudo apt build-dep appstream</pre>

Fedora: <pre>sudo dnf install qt6-qtwebengine-devel qt6-qt5compat-devel qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtbase-private-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel qt6-qtlocation-devel qt6-qtmultimedia-devel qt6-qtpositioning-devel qt6-qtwayland-devel qt6-qttools qt6-qtshadertools-devel qt6-qtsensors-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-linguist qt6-qttools-devel qt6-qtwebsockets-devel expat-devel libcurl-devel libyaml-devel gtk-doc
sudo dnf builddep  appstream
</pre>

openSUSE: <pre></pre>

`Step 5.` Test the kdesrc-build installations for Qt5 (kf5-qt5) and Qt6 (kf6-qt6).

I recomend this order:

<pre>
cd ~/kde5/src/kdesrc-build
./kdesrc-build kconfig
./kdesrc-build kcalc
./kdesrc-run kcalc
./kdesrc-build frameworks
</pre>

<pre>
cd ~/kde6/src/kdesrc-build
./kdesrc-build kconfig
./kdesrc-build kcalc
./kdesrc-run kcalc
./kdesrc-build frameworks
</pre>

## Set up a development environment

{{Info|'''Everything on this page only needs to be done once.''' Once you've done it, your development environment is set up and you can use it to submit patches and develop KDE Software!}}

{{Note|This procedure will set up kdesrc-build for Qt5 and KDE Frameworks 5.<br/>
Setting up kdesrc-build for Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6 and setting up kdesrc-build inside a Docker container are [[Get_Involved/development/More|advanced topics]].}}

Source code for KDE software lives on [https://invent.kde.org KDE Invent]. But before you can work on it, you'll need to set up a '''development environment''': a set of tools that allows you to access and edit the source code, compile it into a form that the computer can run, and deploy it to a safe location. We will now go through the process of setting one up. To accomplish these tasks, you will need to enter commands using a terminal program, such as KDE's [https://apps.kde.org/konsole Konsole].

If you're not familiar with the command line interface, you can [[Get_Involved/development/Learn#Unix_command_line|find tutorials here]]. However, advanced command-line skills are not required, and you will learn what you need along the way!

If you're a visual learner, video tutorials can be found [[Get_Involved/development/Video|here]].

== Install basic tools ==
First you will need to use your operating system's package manager to install some basic tools:
* KDE Neon/Kubuntu/Ubuntu/Debian: <code>sudo apt install git cmake</code>
* Arch/Manjaro: <code>sudo pacman -S git cmake dialog extra-cmake-modules</code>
* Fedora: <code>sudo dnf install git cmake perl perl-IPC-Cmd perl-MD5 perl-FindBin</code>
* openSUSE Leap & Tumbleweed: <code>sudo zypper install git breezy cmake dialog</code>

== Configure Git ==
We need to set your authorship information properly so that any changes you make can be properly attributed to you:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@email.com"
</nowiki>}}

The name you provide should be your actual name, not your KDE Identity username or a pseudonym. And the email address must be the same as the email address used for your https://bugs.kde.org account. If they don't match, then the <code>BUG: </code> and <code>FEATURE: </code> keywords won't work (see [https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Git/Configuration#Basic_Settings this page] for more information).}}

Next, in order to authenticate yourself when pushing code changes, you need to add an ssh key to your GitLab profile as [https://invent.kde.org/help/user/ssh.md described here].

== Set up kdesrc-build ==
<code>kdesrc-build</code> is the official KDE meta-build-system tool. It is used to manage the building of many software repositories in an automated fashion. Its primary purpose is to '''manage dependencies'''. Every software has dependencies: other pieces of software that provide lower-level functionality they rely on. In order to compile any piece of software, its dependencies must be available. KDE software has two types of dependencies: dependencies on other pieces of KDE software, and dependencies on 3rd-party software. E.g. the KDE application KCalc depends on more than 20 other KDE git repositories. Also, KCalc depends on the Qt framework and on the libraries GNU GMP and GNU MPFR.

Because most Linux operating systems do not provide development packages of the KDE Frameworks 5 and of other KDE libraries that are up-to-date enough for us to build from the "master" branch of the KDE git repositories, we use <code>kdesrc-build</code> to compile the needed KDE Frameworks and KDE libraries ourselves. The goal is to avoid using KDE binaries, KDE libraries and other KDE files from the operating system (i.e. the /usr directory).

Let's set it up now! First, create a new directory for all the KDE source code. You will need many gigabytes of free disk space. Budget 50 GB for KDE Frameworks + KDE Plasma, and 10-30 GB more for some apps as well. Then clone the <code>kdesrc-build</code> git repository in that directory:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
mkdir -p ~/kde/src
cd ~/kde/src/
git clone https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build.git && cd kdesrc-build
</nowiki>}}

Next, some distros need source repos enabled before you can install the development packages you need. Do that now, if needed:

* '''KDE neon/Debian/Ubuntu/Kubuntu/etc:''' <code>sudo sed -i '/deb-src/s/^# //' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt update</code>
* '''openSUSE Leap & Tumbleweed:''' <code>sudo zypper mr -e $(zypper repos | awk '/source/{print $5}')</code>

With that done, it's time to run the initial setup program, which will make some changes to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (or  <code>~/.zshrc</code> for zsh users) and install necessary 3rd-party packages:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
./kdesrc-build --initial-setup
source ~/.bashrc
</nowiki>}}

{{Note|If you use the zsh shell and you have selected yes for auto-completions during the initial setup for <code>kdesrc-build</code>, add the following two lines to the configuration file <code>~/.zshrc</code> if the lines do not exist in the file.
<pre>
autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
</pre>
}}

For more details about 3rd-party dependencies, see [[Get_Involved/development/Install_the_dependencies]]

{{Note|This process installs 3rd-party dependencies once, but they can change over time, and <code>kdesrc-build</code> is currently not smart enough to track those changes and apply them later; see https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build/-/issues/9 for more details. So if in the future, you happen to find any external dependencies needed to build KDE software that were not installed with <code>kdesrc-build --initial-setup</code>, then once you finish this tutorial, please send a merge request to https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build/-/blob/master/modules/ksb/FirstRun.pm in order to include the needed packages to the list.}}

== Set up Qt ==
Qt is the fundamental framework that is needed for pretty much all KDE development. A recent enough version of Qt is required to proceed.

You can look up the version of the Qt framework installed on your operating system by opening the application "Info Center" (KInfoCenter) > Basic Information > About this System > "Qt Version:"

If Qt 5.15 or later is installed, you're already done done with this step and can proceed to the next section! 🎉

...Otherwise it's time to compile a more recent version of Qt using <code>kdesrc-build</code>. See [[Get_Involved/development/More#Build_Qt_using_kdesrc-build|Building Qt using kdesrc-build]] to learn how. If you're just getting started with development, it may be a good time to switch distros to something [[Get_Involved/development#Operating_system|better suited for building KDE software from source code]] either as the primary operating system or in a virtual machine. But if you are an advanced user, feel free to compile your own Qt.

== Disable indexing for your development environment ==
You'll want to disable indexing for your development-related git repos and the files they will build and install. Add <tt>~/kde</tt> to the exclusions list in System Settings > Workspace > Search > File Search, like so:

[[File:Getting involved development file index options.png|center|600px|]]

== Next Steps ==
'''Reboot your computer''' and log back in so the package changes, and the <code>~/.bashrc</code> changes take effect on your user account. Once that's done, your development environment is set up and ready to build software. Time to learn how to use <code>kdesrc-build</code> tool to [[Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build|manage and build software from source code]]!

# 2. Page https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build

## Build software with kdesrc-build

On this page, you can learn how to use KDE's <code>kdesrc-build</code> tool to build various types of KDE software once you have a [[Get_Involved/development/Set_up_a_development_environment|development environment set up]].

It can take an hour or more to compile a KDE application, Framework, or Plasma itself for the first time. The reason for this is that <code>kdesrc-build</code> is compiling all of the KDE Frameworks 5 modules plus any other KDE module that is a dependency of the module that you tell <code>kdesrc-build</code> to build.

<code>kdesrc-build</code> by default has the option "--include-dependencies" enabled so it will ignore all KDE packages that were installed using the distribution's package manager and will instead build all needed KDE modules from source.

The next time you want to compile that or any other piece of KDE software, it will be much faster since most of the dependencies will have already been compiled. If you don't want to build all dependencies (e.g., because you are using a rolling release distro that provides recent versions of software), edit the same configuration file and simply set <code>include-dependencies</code> to '''false''' or add the <code>--no-include-dependencies</code> option when running <code>kdesrc-build</code>.

== Frameworks ==
'''[[Frameworks|KDE Frameworks]]''' are libraries of tools and features that can be used by any application or Plasma itself. New versions of KDE Frameworks are [[Schedules/Frameworks|released once a month]]. A list of all of the frameworks can be found here: https://api.kde.org/frameworks.

Usually there is no reason to build frameworks manually, by using the "--include-dependencies" option the necessary ones are included automatically.

== Applications ==

[https://apps.kde.org/ KDE Applications] like [https://apps.kde.org/kcalc Calculator (KCalc)], [https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/ Dolphin], [https://apps.kde.org/okular/ Okular], [https://apps.kde.org/konsole/ Konsole] and [https://apps.kde.org/gwenview/ Gwenview] are standalone apps that can be run on multiple platforms, such as Plasma, GNOME, even macOS and Windows! New versions of KDE Applications are [[Schedules#Current_Releases_by_KDE|released three times a year]]. Note that the Discover app store (git repo name: <code>plasma-discover</code>) and System Settings app (git repo name: <code>systemsettings</code>) are distributed alongside Plasma, but they build like apps using the below instructions. A list of all KDE applications can be found here: https://apps.kde.org/.

The general steps required to build and run an application are described in the following using KCalc as an example:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build kcalc
</nowiki>}}

This command clones the KDE git repository https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kcalc in the directory <code>~/kde/src/kcalc</code>, builds all of KCalc's KDE dependencies, and then builds KCalc itself, into the directory <code>~/kde/build/kcalc</code>. If the build is successful, the result is installed into <code>~/kde/usr</code>. As a result, '''there is no need to manually install anything;''' <code>kdesrc-build</code> installed it for you!

To run it, use the <code>kdesrc-run</code> command, which launches the built-from-source version instead of the one installed by your system's package manager.
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-run kcalc
</nowiki>}}

Did it run? If so, then '''congratulations, you just compiled your own version of KCalc from source code!'''

== Plasma ==
'''[[Plasma|KDE Plasma]]''' is the environment in which you can run apps. Plasma is responsible for providing a desktop with wallpaper, app launchers, and widgets; displaying notifications; managing wired and wireless networks; and similar operating-system level tasks. New versions of Plasma are [[Schedules/Plasma 5|released three times a year]]. Plasma has multiple ''shells'': [https://kde.org/plasma-desktop Plasma Desktop] for desktop, laptop, and 2-in-1 computers, [https://www.plasma-mobile.org/ Plasma Mobile] for mobile phones, [https://plasma-bigscreen.org/ Plasma Bigscreen] for televisions, and so on. They all share certain common components, such as a window manager, networking stack, basic graphical components, and so on. Here is how to build the common components:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build plasma-workspace plasma-framework plasma-integration bluedevil powerdevil plasma-nm plasma-pa plasma-thunderbolt plasma-vault plasma-firewall plasma-workspace-wallpapers kdeplasma-addons krunner milou kwin kscreen sddm-kcm plymouth-kcm breeze discover print-manager plasma-sdk kdeconnect-kde plasma-browser-integration xdg-desktop-portal-kde kde-gtk-config kgamma5 breeze-gtk drkonqi phonon flatpak-kcm kactivitymanagerd --include-dependencies
</nowiki>}}

=== Plasma Desktop ===
To build the Plasma Desktop environment and its related apps, also build the following:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build plasma-desktop systemsettings plasma-disks plasma-systemmonitor ksystemstats kinfocenter kmenuedit --include-dependencies
</nowiki>}}

To get translations in your self-built Plasma, you must build <tt>plasma-workspace</tt> with <code>-DKDE_L10N_SYNC_TRANSLATIONS=true</code>. The easiest way to do this is go into the build directory (<code>~/kde/build/plasma-workspace</code> by default), run <code>ccmake .</code>, turn on that setting, and then rebuild the project.

Now it's time to make your built-from-source Plasma session accessible from the SDDM login screen, and also copy the built-from-source DBus files into a location where they are visible to the system bus. To do this, run the following command:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
~/kde/build/plasma-workspace/login-sessions/install-sessions.sh
</nowiki>}}

{{Note|SELinux can interfere with the new DBus services working correctly, and the path of least resistance may be to simply turn off enforcement if you are using a distro that ships with it on by default (for example, Fedora). To do this, set the value of <code>SELINUX</code> to <code>permissive</code> in the file <code>/etc/selinux</code>.}}

After this, you can log out and select your new plasma session in SDDM's session chooser menu (which is located in the bottom-left corner of the screen if you're using the Breeze SDDM theme).

Alternatively, you can run the new version of plasma on top of your existing system for quick testing like so:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
source ~/kde/build/plasma-desktop/prefix.sh
~/kde/usr/bin/plasmashell --replace
</nowiki>}}

=== Plasma Mobile ===
To build the Plasma Mobile environment, also build the following:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build plasma-nano plasma-mobile plasma-settings --include-dependencies
</nowiki>}}

You can run your custom-built Plasma Mobile in an emulated phone session using a phone-sized window within your existing desktop. Note that you probably want that this emulated phone session does not use the settings of your current user. E.g. you want in the emulated phone session to use Angelfish, not Mozilla Firefox as your web browser. Instructions:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=KDE
export QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=KDE
export KSCREEN_BACKEND=QScreen
export KDE_FULL_SESSION=1
export KDE_SESSION_VERSION=5
export QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_MOBILE=1
export PLASMA_PLATFORM=phone:handheld
export $(dbus-launch)
dbus-run-session kwin_wayland --width 360 --height 720 --xwayland "plasmashell -p org.kde.plasma.phoneshell"
</nowiki>}}

Alternative instructions for starting an emulated phone session.

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
export QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1
export QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_MOBILE=1
export PLASMA_PLATFORM=phone:handheld

QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland dbus-run-session kwin_wayland --xwayland "plasmashell -p org.kde.plasma.phoneshell" --width 360 --height 720
</nowiki>}}

Plasma Mobile can also be run on a mobile device itself. For more information, see the [[Plasma/Mobile/DevGuide#Mobile_device_running_plasma_mobile|DevGuide]].

== How to solve build problems ==
Did one or more modules fail to build (displayed in red font) using <code>kdesrc-build</code>? Then here's what to do:

# Try building the failing module again from scratch using <code>kdesrc-build [failing module] --refresh-build</code>
# Make sure that you have all the dependencies for the failing module. Go back to the [[#Download non-KDE dependencies]] section and re-install the non-KDE dependencies. If that doesn't fix the problem, open the log file for the failing module which <code>kdesrc-build</code> will print the path at the end of its output. Scroll to the bottom of the log file and read the output to see what missing dependency it is complaining about. Then find and install the corresponding package using the package manager of your distribution. If several look relevant, install them all just to be safe. When you have the necessary dependencies, you can save time and resume from the failing module by adding <code>--resume-from [the name of the module that failed]</code> to your <code>kdesrc-build</code> command.
# <s>Check the [https://build.kde.org/view/Failing/ list of currently broken modules] on the KDE build server.</s> The link is broken. But you can check the pipeline for individual project. If it's broken there, then it's not your fault. :)
# Ask for help in the the [https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-devel:kde.org #kde-devel] channel on [[Matrix]] or Libera Chat [[Internet Relay Chat | IRC]]. See [[Get Involved/development#Communicate with the team]]
# Looking into the error log is also helpful. For example, the build stopped at kwallet. You will need to go into <code>kde/src/log/latest/kwallet/error.log</code> and find what packages are missing.
# If you know what files are missing, but you don't know what packages provide them, you can ask your package manager. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Rosetta (see "Query the package which provides FILE").
# The problem might be in <code>~/kde/usr</code>. E.g. a file in <code>~/kde/usr/include</code> which was renamed or moved. You can help yourself by seeing if you can reproduce this issue in a clean new Virtual Machine (VM). If you cannot reproduce the issue in your VM, then a possible solution is to start with a new and clean kdesrc-build installation. I.e. run something like <code>mv ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc~bak ; mv ~/kde ~/kde~bak</code>. Then install kdesrc-build from scratch using this wiki page.

== Iterating on a single project ==
When you're working on a project and you want to rebuild it to test your changes, you can save a lot of time by only rebuilding that project, rather than the entire stack. For example if you are working on <code>plasma-desktop</code>, you can rebuild only that project rather than everything by running <code>kdesrc-build --no-src --no-include-dependencies plasma-desktop</code>.

== How to run an application after making changes to one of its dependencies ==
Build the application that you want to build. E.g. to return to KCalc:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build kcalc
</nowiki>}}

This command builds not only KCalc, but all of the KDE git repositories on which it depends, such as the KDE Frameworks 5 library KConfig.

Now let's say you want to make a change to KConfig that should change a behavior in KCalc. In this case, you don't want kdesrc-build to discard your changes to KConfig. So first build KConfig separately, on its own, without doing a source code update:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build kconfig --no-src --no-include-dependencies --refresh-build --debug
</nowiki>}}

This will build just KConfig and install the needed build products into <code>~/kde/usr</code>. Now we want to run KCalc in such a way that it makes use of those changed files. Do it like so:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build kcalc --no-src --no-include-dependencies --refresh-build --debug
kdesrc-run kcalc
</nowiki>}}

== Next Steps ==
Now you can compile anything in KDE from its source code! Time to think about [[Get_Involved/development#Choose what_to_work_on|what to do with this superpower]]...


# 3. Page https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/More

## More

This page is the continuation with more advanced topics of the page [[Get_Involved/development]].

This page is not meant for people that are starting to program for KDE.

== Develop in a Linux container ==

When you start programming for KDE, it is recommended that you [[Get_Involved/development|use kdesrc-build in your main operating system or in a virtual machine]] running on a rolling-release Linux distribution (Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed, KDE neon) or running on e.g. the latest version of Fedora KDE Spin or Kubuntu.

As an alternative, you can run kdesrc-build in a Linux container (docker, podman, toolbx, distrobox).

=== Option 1. The KDE PIM Docker image ===

You can install Docker and the [[KDE PIM/Docker|KDE PIM Docker image]]. It provides a development environment that is isolated from your day-to-day system. It is based on KDE Neon Unstable.

=== Option 2. distrobox ===

Or, you can just create a long lived (pet not cattle) container using distrobox and podman (or docker). See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JEALbcmcCg and https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox to learn more about distrobox and how to use it in general.

First, install distrobox and podman from your distribution repositories. Then run:

{{Input|
distrobox enter
}}

This should create a container based on your current Linux OS and enter it. It is preferable to use one of the Linux distributions that is better suited for kdesrc-build, as mentioned [[Get_Involved/development#Operating_system|in this wiki page]], so if your distribution does not provide very up-to-date packages, you can download and use a different container image for your distrobox from [https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image Dockerhub]. For example, with openSUSE Tumbleweed:

{{Input|
podman pull opensuse/tumbleweed
distrobox create --image opensuse/tumbleweed --name tumbleweed
distrobox enter tumbleweed
}}

Then it's a matter of downloading and running kdesrc-build as detailed in [[Get_Involved/development/Set_up_a_development_environment]]:

{{Input|<nowiki>
mkdir -p ~/kde/src
cd ~/kde/src
git clone https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build.git
./kdesrc-build --initial-setup
source ~/.bashrc
</nowiki>}}

From this point on, one important thing to bear in mind is that a distrobox container is transparent in its user space and containerized in its root space: when you are inside a distrobox container, you can see the content of system's home folder, but not your system's root folders, only the container's root folders. This means that you can install packages inside the container using root privileges and access those packages to compile your programs stored in your home, without ever installing those packages in your actual system!

You can take advantage of this by installing, for instance, Qt development packages used for kdesrc-build from inside the container. This way, it is not necessary to compile Qt with kdesrc-build. This is particularly convenient if you want to compile KDE software with Qt6 quickly.

Likewise, you should [https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Install_the_dependencies install the required dependencies] from inside the distrobox rather than from your system's repositories. Then you can start compiling as usual.

After compiling your program with kdesrc-build from inside the distrobox, you can run it with <code>kdesrc-build run</code>, and despite it originating from inside a container and using the libraries from the container, it will run just fine as a GUI application on your system!

The only few gotchas to using this method are:

* You cannot use a [[Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build#Plasma|full Plasma Desktop session]] made from git.
* You will need qqc2-desktop-style and Breeze to show the correct theme for your applications.
* You will need the QtWayland library and its respective development package to run your applications natively on a Wayland session.

== Other operating systems ==

=== FreeBSD ===

Install the latest release of FreeBSD with KDE Plasma Desktop on your hardware computer or in a virtual machine.

Your user should be member of the "wheel" user group (e.g. this can be configured in the FreeBSD installer, when creating your user you can select additional user groups for your user). Your user should be able to use sudo:

<pre>
pkg install sudo
visudo
# Uncomment the line: %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
</pre>

Then set up kdesrc-build using the same procedure as when installing kdesrc-build on a Linux operating system. FreeBSD is currently supported by kdesrc-build. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2wq0eTnUuc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT-AN4J-hn8

=== Microsoft Windows ===

You can build and develop KDE projects using the [[Get_Involved/development/Windows|Microsoft Windows]] operating system.

=== Apple macOS ===

You can build and develop KDE projects using the [[Get_Involved/development/Mac|Apple macOS]] operating system.

== What to do if CMake configure fails because a build dependency is missing ==

If you run kdesrc-build in order to build a KDE git repository. And if building fails with a CMake error. Then, that is most often caused by the fact that you do not have installed some binary packages from your Linux OS.

See below for some ideas about how to find out what Linux packages you need to install.

=== Debian/Kubuntu/KDE neon ===

E.g. I am on Kubuntu 22.10, <code>kdesrc-build frameworks</code> fails, module <code>kcoreaddons</code> has CMake (configure) error <code>Could NOT find Qt6LinguistTools (missing: Qt6LinguistTools_DIR)</code>.

Option 1:

Search on the internet for <code>ubuntu packages Qt6LinguistTools</code> it returns https://packages.ubuntu.com/kinetic/amd64/qt6-tools-dev Expand "amd64 [list of files]": <code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt6LinguistTools/Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake</code>

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
sudo apt install qt6-tools-dev
</nowiki>}}

Option 2:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
sudo apt install apt-file
sudo apt-file update
apt-file find Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake
# qt6-tools-dev: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt6LinguistTools/Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake
sudo apt install qt6-tools-dev
</nowiki>}}

If the error is:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
The imported target "Qt6::qtwaylandscanner" references the file
     "/usr/lib/qt6/libexec/qtwaylandscanner"
but this file does not exist.
</nowiki>}}

Then:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
apt-file find /usr/lib/qt6/libexec/qtwaylandscanner
# qt6-wayland-dev-tools: /usr/lib/qt6/libexec/qtwaylandscanner
sudo apt install qt6-wayland-dev-tools
</nowiki>}}

Option 3:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
apt search linguist | grep qt6
# linguist-qt6/kinetic 6.3.1-2 amd64
sudo apt install linguist-qt6
</nowiki>}}

More examples:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# Error "Could not find OsmTools (missing: OSMCONVERT_EXECUTABLE
apt-file search -i OSMCONVERT
# Returns "osmctools: /usr/bin/osmconvert".
sudo apt install osmctools
</nowiki>}}

<pre>
# Error "Program doxygen found: NO
# doc/meson.build:6:0: ERROR: Program 'doxygen' not found or not executable"
apt-file search doxygen | grep "/doxygen$"
#doxygen: /usr/bin/doxygen
#polymake-common: /usr/share/polymake/scripts/doxygen
sudo apt install doxygen
</pre>

=== Fedora ===

<code>sudo dnf provides "NameOrPathOfFileThatIsMissing"</code>

See https://invent.kde.org/redstrate/cmake-package-installer/-/blob/master/src/main.rs

E.g. if the error is:
<pre>
Failed to find required Qt component "LinguistTools".

Expected Config file at
"/lib64/cmake/Qt6LinguistTools/Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake" does NOT exist
</pre>

run:
<pre>
dnf provides Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake
# Error: No matches found. If searching for a file, try specifying the full path
# or using a wildcard prefix ("*/") at the beginning.

dnf provides */Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake
# qt6-qttools-devel-6.5.1-1.fc38.i686 : Development files for qt6-qttools
# Repo        : updates
# Matched from:
# Filename    : /usr/lib/cmake/Qt6LinguistTools/Qt6LinguistToolsConfig.cmake
</pre>

== Advanced kdesrc-build ==

After you have edited a git repository and you want to build it, <code>--no-src</code> will make sure that <code>kdesrc-build</code> does not overwrite your changes with the latest source code from the official git repository (remote "origin" / https://invent/kde.org).

<code>--no-include-dependencies</code> only builds the git repository that you give as parameter to <code>kdesrc-build</code>.

<code>--debug</code> shows verbose output.

<code>--refresh-build</code> forces a rebuild (not an incremental build) and a full reinstall.

E.g. you have edited kcalc. You run:
<pre>
kdesrc-build kcalc --no-src --no-include-dependencies --refresh-build --debug |& tee ~/a.txt
</pre>

For details, see:
<pre>
kdesrc-build --help
</pre>

== Build Qt using kdesrc-build ==

Set up kdesrc-build from scratch as usual.

Open the configuration file <code>~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc</code> and confirm that <code>qtdir</code> and the lines <code>include...qt5-build-include</code> and <code>include...custom-qt5-libs-build-include</code> are not commented out (i.e. there should not be a <code>#</code> in front of the lines). E.g. (replace "username" with your Linux user's name):

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
qtdir ~/kde/usr # Where to make install Qt5
include /home/username/kde/src/kdesrc-build/qt5-build-include
include /home/username/kde/src/kdesrc-build/custom-qt5-libs-build-include
</nowiki>}}

Run in a terminal:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build qt5-set
kdesrc-build frameworks
</nowiki>}}

== kf5-qt5 vs. kf5-qt6 vs. kf6-qt6 ==

For now, the KDE git repositories from https://invent.kde.org/frameworks and https://invent.kde.org/plasma/ can build correctly and run correctly using "kdesrc-build kf6-qt6".

The KDE git repositories that can build correctly and run correctly using "kdesrc-build kf6-qt6" have two long lived git branches:

* A long lived git branch that does not contain the deprecated symbols from kf5-qt5, named e.g. "master".
* And another long lived git branch for qt5-kf5 and qt6-kf5, where the deprecated symbols still exist.

What is "kf5-qt5"? You just set up kdesrc-build following the procedure. The resulting kdesrc-build installation will be of type kf5-qt5. In kdesrc-buildrc in the "global" section you will have "branch-group kf5-qt5". The git repositories that have only one long lived git branch e.g. named "master" will use that. The git repositories that have a second long lived git branch where the deprecated symbols still exist e.g. named "kf5" will use that.

What is "kf5-qt6"? "kf5-qt6" is not supported and should not be used. You just set up kdesrc-build following the procedure. The resulting kdesrc-build installation will be of type kf5-qt5. In kdesrc-buildrc in the "global" section you will have "branch-group kf5-qt5", you keep this unchanged. You edit kdesrc-buildrc to make kdesrc-build use Qt6 instead of Qt5. The git repositories that have only one long lived git branch e.g. named "master" will use that. The git repositories that have a second long lived git branch where the deprecated symbols still exist e.g. named "kf5" will use that.

What is "kf6-qt6"? You just set up kdesrc-build following the procedure. The resulting kdesrc-build installation will be of type kf5-qt5. In kdesrc-buildrc in the "global" section you will have "branch-group kf5-qt5", you replace that with "branch-group kf6-qt6". You edit kdesrc-buildrc to make kdesrc-build use Qt6 instead of Qt5. The git repositories that have only one long lived git branch e.g. named "master" will use that. The git repositories that have a second long lived git branch, will use the git branch where the deprecated symbols do not exist e.g. named "master".

=== Why kdesrc-build kf6-qt6 cannot build and run neochat correctly? ===

neochat does not have a second long lived git branch where the deprecated symbols do not exist.

<code>kdesrc-build neochat</code> for kf6-qt6 succeeds, but then <code>kdesrc-run neochat</code> for kf6-qt6 fails because
<pre>
qrc:/RoomListContextMenu.qml:200:27: Invalid property assignment: unsupported type "QQuickIcon"
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>

<pre>
# The file ~/kde/src/neochat/src/qml/Menu/RoomListContextMenu.qml at line 200 says:
Kirigami.BasicListItem {
    text: i18n("Mark as Read")
    icon: "checkmark"
</pre>

The symbol <code>Kirigami.BasicListItem.icon</code> of type string is deprecated and exists in kf5-qt5. In kf6-qt6 we use the symbol of type string <code>Kirigami.BasicListItem.icon.name</code>.

== kdesrc-build, Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6 ==

=== Using kdesrc-buildrc-kf6-sample ===
KDE projects are currently transitioning to use Qt6. You can build the in-development Qt6 versions using kdesrc-build by adjusting the .config/kdesrc-buildrc file. You can find a sample kdesrc-buildrc file [https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build/-/blob/master/kdesrc-buildrc-kf6-sample here].

The important differences to Qt5 are:

<code>branch-group kf6-qt6</code>: This will check out the correct git branches.

<code>prefix ~/kde6/usr</code>: It is recommended to use a different prefix for Qt6-based builds than for the Qt5-based builds

Save the file e.g. as <code>/home/user/kde6/kdesrc-buildrc</code>.

Then you can use <code>kdesrc-build --rc-file=/home/user/kde6/kdesrc-buildrc ...</code> to build things against Qt6

=== Editing ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc ===

Set up kdesrc-build following the "Set up kdesrc-build" procedure. The resulting kdesrc-build installation will be of type kf5-qt5. In kdesrc-buildrc in the "global" section you will have "branch-group kf5-qt5".

Edit the file <code>~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc</code>
* Replace all "5" with "6".
* Replace:
<pre>cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo</pre>
with:
<pre>cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DQT_MAJOR_VERSION=6 -DBUILD_WITH_QT6=ON</pre>

== Packages needed by kdesrc-build kf6-qt6 ==

"kdesrc-build --initial-setup" should install from your Operating System (OS) at least the packages that are needed for "kdesrc-build frameworks" to succeed.

"kdesrc-build --initial-setup" by default sets up kdesrc-build kf5-qt5 and installs packages from your OS that are needed for kdesrc-build kf5-qt5.

Below is the list of OS packages that kdesrc-build would install if it knew how to set up kdesrc-build kf6-qt6.

* Debian/Ubuntu:
<pre>
sudo apt install qt6-tools-dev qt6-declarative-dev libqt6core5compat6-dev qt6-wayland qt6-wayland-dev qt6-wayland-dev-tools qt6-base-private-dev libqt6svg6-dev libqt6opengl6-dev libqt6shadertools6-dev doxygen xsltproc xmlto texinfo libcanberra-dev
sudo apt build-dep appstream
</pre>

* openSUSE Tumbleweed: <code>sudo zypper in patterns-kde-devel_qt6 qt6-wayland-private-devel gobject-introspection-devel snowball-devel itstool libdisplay-info-devel</code>. For Plasma you will also need the following runtime dependency: <code>sudo zypper in qt6-qt5compat-imports</code>
* Arch Linux: <code>sudo pacman -S poppler-qt6 qca-qt6 qt6-5compat qt6-base qt6-charts qt6-declarative qt6-multimedia qt6-multimedia-ffmpeg qt6-positioning qt6-tools qt6-translations qt6-wayland qt6-webchannel qt6-webengine qt6-websockets qt6-webview qtkeychain-qt6 qcoro-qt6 qt6-svg qt6-shadertools qt6-sensors</code>

* FreeBSD: <code>sudo pkg install qt6</code>

== Build Qt6 using kdesrc-build ==

A screen recording version is available https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDzX0376QyA

Note: If you cannot build the KDE frameworks using kdesrc-build and using the Qt6 provided by your OS (Linux distribution). Because the Qt6 is not complete. You might want to build Qt6 using kdesrc-build.

Note: Building Qt6 using kdesrc-build is an advanced topic.

Set up kdesrc-build clean from scratch following the same procedure as when using "Qt5 and KDE Frameworks 5".

Edit two files.

== Portable installation of kdesrc-build ==

The current directory (pwd) is important when running kdesrc-build. If there exists a file kdesrc-buildrc in the the current directory (pwd), kdesrc-build will prefer that file over ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc.

If you are interested in or need separate builds of KDE software, like when building with Qt5 or Qt6, you can create a self-contained, portable installation of kdesrc-build in its own folder. This way, you can manage your kdesrc-build configuration files each in their own environment without mixing configurations or having to rebuild the universe every time you want to test a different one.

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# To not lose your previous build, make a backup:
mv ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc~bak && mv ~/kde ~/kde~bak
# Edit ~/.bashrc file and remove the kdesrc-build block.
# Set up kdesrc-build by following just the chapter https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development#Set_up_kdesrc-build
# Make sure to answer "No" when it asks if you want to add the kdesrc-build block to ~/.bashrc.
# Do not source ~/.bashrc.
# Edit ~/.bashrc file and remove the kdesrc-build block.
# Reboot the computer or relogin such that the $PATH environment variable
# does not contain the string "~/kde" or sub directories of "~/kde".
# You should not have built anything using kdesrc-build yet.
# Then move the generated kdesrc-buildrc to inside the new ~/kde folder:
mv ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc ~/kde
# This will make kdesrc-build use this file even if ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc exists.
# Then link kdesrc-build and kdesrc-run to the root of the ~/kde folder:
cd ~/kde
ln -s src/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-build .
ln -s src/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-run .
# Edit the file paths in ~/kde/kdesrc-buildrc
cd ~/kde
# Calling ~/kde/kdesrc-build will then only use the current folder's kdesrc-buildrc:
./kdesrc-build frameworks
mv ~/kde ~/kde.5 # Or to any other directory.
# Edit the file paths in the file ~/kde.5/kdesrc-buildrc
cd ~/kde.5
./kdesrc-build frameworks --refresh-build # Because binary files contain file full paths starting with "~/kde".
</nowiki>}}

== Two independent kdesrc-build installations on the same machine: kf6-qt6 and kf5-qt5 ==

Make a backup of your existing kdesrc-build setup.
<code>mv ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc~bak && mv ~/kde ~/kde~bak</code>

Set up a portable kdesrc-build from scratch in the directory <code>~/kde</code>. See the chapter [[#Portable installation of kdesrc-build]] for details. But do not run kdesrc-build to build anything.

In the directory <code>~/kde</code> there will be a new kdesrc-build installation of type <code>kf5-qt5</code>.

At the end of this procedure there will be two independent and portable kdesrc-build installations:
* <code>~/kde5</code> - <code>kf5-qt5</code>
* <code>~/kde6</code> - <code>kf6-qt6</code>

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# kf5-qt5 kdesrc-build installation.
cp ~/kde ~/kde5 # Or to any other directory.
# Edit the file paths in the file ~/kde5/kdesrc-buildrc to point to "~/kde5" instead of "~/kde".
cd ~/kde5
./kdesrc-build frameworks --refresh-build # Because binary files contain file full paths starting with "~/kde".
# Now you have a kdesrc-build kf5-qt5 installation in ~/kde5

# kf6-qt6 kdesrc-build installation.
mv ~/kde ~/kde6 # Or to any other directory.
# Edit the file ~/kde6/kdesrc-buildrc such that the kdesrc-build installation becomes one of type kf6-qt6.
# See this wiki page for examples on how to convert a kf5-qt5 kdesrc-build installation to a kf6-qt6 kdesrc-build installation.
# Edit the file paths in the file ~/kde6/kdesrc-buildrc to point to "~/kde6" instead of "~/kde".
cd ~/kde6
./kdesrc-build frameworks --refresh-build # Because binary files contain file full paths starting with "~/kde".
# Now you have a kdesrc-build kf6-qt6 installation in ~/kde6
</nowiki>}}

Usage:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# Use different terminal windows or tabs (e.g. different Konsole tabs) for
# kf5-qt5 and kf6-qt6

# Go to the terminal window or tab for kf5-qt5.
cd ~/kde5
./kdesrc-build kcalc
./kdesrc-run kcalc

# Go to the terminal window or tab for kf6-qt6.
cd ~/kde6
./kdesrc-build plasma-systemmonitor
./kdesrc-run plasma-systemmonitor
</nowiki>}}

== What is the command line of the processes started by kdesrc-build ==

E.g. what are the command lines that are run by kdesrc-build in order to run the CMake configure step for the kconfig KDE git repository?

{{Input|1=<nowiki>

== How to write the entire verbose STDOUT and STDERR of kdesrc-build to a file ==

<pre>
script -eq -c "kdesrc-build kconfig --no-src --no-include-dependencies --refresh-build --debug" ~/a.txt
</pre>

Note: you can remove the terminal ANSI color codes using e.g. <code>ansi2txt</code>, available e.g. in the package <code>colorized-logs</code>. E.g.
<pre>
sudo apt install colorized-logs
cat ~/a.txt | ansi2txt > ~/a_script.txt
</pre>

<code>script -eq -c "command" ~/a.txt</code> is better than <code>command |& tee ~/a.txt</code> because kdesrc-build behaves differently if it is run in a user interactive terminal session (<code>isatty</code>).

If using <code>tee</code>, part of the output of kdesrc-build will not be written to file. E.g. the output of the <code>cmake</code> step, the final part of the <code>make -j</code> step, the final part of the <code>make install</code> step.

== Other CPU architectures than x86_64/amd64 and x86 ==

You can build and develop KDE projects using a Linux OS installed on an  [[Get_Involved/development/ARM|ARM]] architecture CPU.

== kdesrc-build issues ==

=== "kdesrc-build kfilemetadata" fails because of appimage ===

This happens on KDE neon.

Solution:
<pre>
sudo apt remove libappimage-dev
</pre>

=== wayland-protocols is too old, e.g. "kdesrc-build kidletime" fails ===

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/kde/misc && cd ~/kde/misc
wget https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/releases/1.31/downloads/wayland-protocols-1.31.tar.xz
tar -xJvf wayland-protocols-*.tar.xz && mv wayland-protocols-*/ wayland-protocols
cd wayland-protocols
meson setup builddir --prefix $HOME/kde/usr
meson compile -C builddir
meson install -C builddir
</pre>

=== "kdesrc-build kpat" fails because of black-hole-solitaire ===

This happens on Debian/Ubuntu/Kubuntu. Because there is no Linux distribution binary package for https://github.com/shlomif/black-hole-solitaire.

Solution: append at the end of kdesrc-buildrc file:
<pre>
options kpat
    cmake-options -DWITH_BH_SOLVER=OFF
end options
</pre>

=== "kdesrc-build frameworks" fails because of qtwebkit ===

Note: qtwebkit and kdewebkit are Qt5 only.

Some Linux OSes do not have a package for qtwebkit anymore. E.g. the Arch Linux family.

When you want to build all of the KDE Frameworks 5 using kdesrc-build, exclude kdewebkit.

<pre>
kdesrc-build frameworks --ignore-modules kdewebkit
</pre>

=== libdisplay-info is not available ===

If your Linux OS does not have a package for libdisplay-info.
Append at the end of the file <code>kdesrc-buildrc</code>:
<pre>
module libdisplay-info
  repository https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/emersion/libdisplay-info.git
end module
</pre>

=== gpgme fails to build ===

# 4. Page https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/IDE_configuration/Qt_Creator

Qt Creator is an IDE from Qt.

A screen recording version is available https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASnDeEaXnbI

== Features ==

Qt Creator is a good choice when starting to contribute to KDE.

Qt Creator has: support for kdesrc-build, a good debugger, source code navigation, Qt widgets UI designer, basic QML editor, QML debugger, Qt resources editor, Qt project templates, good CMake support, C++ static analyzers.

Additional features:
* Source code navigation: switch header/source, follow symbol, switch between function declaration/definition, find references, open type hierarchy, open include hierarchy.
* Refactor rename symbol.
* Views: class view, tests view, document outline view and document outline combo box, CMake structure view, file system view.

For best results, download Qt Creator from the Qt website. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVgInye6HDA

==kdesrc-build==

After you configure kdesrc-build and you can correctly build a KDE project such as kcalc.

Edit ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc . It should look like:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
...
    include-dependencies true
...
    kdedir ~/kde/usr
...
    source-dir ~/kde/src
...
    build-dir ~/kde/build
...
    cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
...
</nowiki>}}

The line above is important in order to use the debugger from Qt Creator.

Make sure you have the correct number on the line <code>num-cores </code>.

Build kcalc, make sure there are no errors:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build kcalc
</nowiki>}}

==Install Qt Creator==

Install Qt Creator. E.g. download from the Qt website https://www.qt.io/ the latest version. Video version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVgInye6HDA

The newest version of Qt Creator installed from the Qt website will have the latest features and the latest bug fixes.

Or e.g. from your current Linux distribution's packages. E.g.
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
apt install qtcreator
</nowiki>}}

===QML Designer===

Qt Creator has a "forms editor" for QML. You can enable it from the Qt Creator main menu > Help > About Plugins... > Qt Quick > enable "QmlDesigner". If it asks you to restart Qt Creator, do it.

Test it. From Qt Designer main menu > File > Close all Files and Editors. File > New Project... > Application (Qt) > Qt Quick Application, finish the wizard correctly. Open the file "Main.qml" in "Switch to Edit mode Ctrl+2". In the left hand side, choose "Switch to Design mode Ctrl+3".

From the Qt Creator main menu > View > Workspaces > Views-All. Close all of the tool windows (views) that you do not need, e.g. "3D", "States", "Timeline", "Curves", "Transitions".

==Load a KDE git repository in Qt Creator==

We use kcalc as the example KDE git repository. Make sure it was built correctly using kdesrc-build.

<pre>
kdesrc-build kcalc
</pre>

Start Qt Creator. E.g. from the KDE Application Launcher (or from KRunner Alt+F2).

From the qtcreator main menu

> File > Close All Projects and Editors

> File > Open File or Project <code>~/kde/src/kcalc/CMakeLists.txt</code>

Left Sidebar > Switch to Projects mode Ctrl+5 > Manage Kits... Under "Kits > Manual", remove all kits except "Desktop (default)". E.g. select Manual > "Imported Kit" > press the "Remove" button > press the "Apply" button.

Button "Import Existing Build..." > Directory: ~/kde/build/kcalc > Choose.

CMake should be configured correctly. CMake is run automatically, see "General Messages Alt+6".

Left Sidebar > Switch to Projects mode Ctrl+5 > Active project: kcalc. Build & Run: not the Desktop kit (e.g. "Imported Kit") > Build. Build Settings > Edit build configuration: "Debug2".

Translate the content of the file <code>~/kde/build/kcalc/prefix.sh</code> to the syntax of Qt Creator "Batch Edit". E.g. for Debian based distributions if <code>~/kde/build/kcalc/prefix.sh</code> is like:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
export PATH=/home/username/kde/usr/bin:$PATH

# LD_LIBRARY_PATH only needed if you are building without rpath
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/home/username/kde/usr/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}
export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/home/username/kde/usr/etc/xdg:${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS:-/etc/xdg}

export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/plugins:$QT_PLUGIN_PATH
export QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qml:$QML2_IMPORT_PATH

export QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE_PATH=/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qml/QtQuick/Controls.2/:$QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE_PATH
</nowiki>}}

Then the same thing in the syntax of Qt Creator "Batch Edit" looks like this block of text:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
PATH=+/home/username/kde/usr/bin
XDG_DATA_DIRS=+/home/username/kde/usr/share
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=+/home/username/kde/usr/etc/xdg
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=+/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/plugins
QML2_IMPORT_PATH=+/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qml
QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE_PATH=+/home/username/kde/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qml/QtQuick/Controls.2/
</nowiki>}}

You probably want to save the above block of text, in order to reuse it when loading other KDE git repositories in Qt Creator. E.g. to file <code>~/kde/qtcreator_build_environment.txt</code>.

Left Sidebar > Switch to Projects mode Ctrl+5 > Build & Run: not the Desktop kit (e.g. "Imported Kit") > Run. Run Settings > Run > Run configuration: select "kcalc". This is the CMake executable target for the GUI application kcalc. The other items in the combobox e.g. "knumbertest" are binary executable (CTest type) tests. Environment > Use Build Environment > press the Details button > press the "Reset" button if possible > press the "Batch Edit..." button. Paste in there, the text block that you prepared above, then press the OK button.

Click on the left sidebar, the button above "Run Ctrl+R". It should show: Project: kcalc. Kit: not the Desktop kit (e.g. "imported Kit"). Deploy: Deploy Configuration. Build: Debug2. Run: kcalc.

CMake configure was run automatically. You can run it again from the Qt Creator main menu > Build > Run CMake.

You can build by pressing the hammer icon on the lower left with tooltip "Build Project Ctrl+B". Or from the Qt Creator main menu > Build > "Build Project Ctrl+B".

Left Sidebar > Switch to Edit mode (Ctrl+2) > Select "Projects" from the combobox (the other interesting combobox item is "File System"). In the "Projects" left hand treeview > kcalc > kcalc > Source Files > double click on the file kcalc.cpp. The file kcalc.cpp will be shown in the editor view. Click inside the source code in text editor.

In the text editor's top bar > function/identifier/method/type/symbols combobox, select the last item: <code>main(int, char**) -> int</code>. Click on the line with the opening curly bracket of the function main. From the main menu > Debug > Set or Remove Breakpoint (F9).

Left Sidebar > Start debugging of startup project. The debugger will start correctly and break on the source code line with the curly bracket.

From the main menu Debug > Step Over (F10)/Step Into(F11)/Step Out (Shift+F11).

==Enable parallel jobs in Qt Creator==

* Left Sidebar > Switch to Projects mode (Ctrl+5).
* Under the Build settings of the imported kit find the "Build Steps" option.
* Click on the "Details" button on the right side of the "Build Steps" option to access the detailed build configuration.
* Under the "Tool arguments" field add the argument "-j<jobs>".  Replace "<jobs>" with the desired number of parallel jobs you want to use during compilation. For example, if you have a CPU with 16 threads and want to use 12 parallel jobs, you would enter "-j12".
* Save the changes (Autosave) and rebuild your project to get faster compilation.

Enabling parallel jobs allows the compiler to utilize multiple processor cores simultaneously, significantly improving the compilation speed, especially for larger projects. By distributing the compilation tasks across multiple threads, the overall build time can be reduced, leading to a more efficient development workflow.

# 5. Page https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Install_the_dependencies

If you have any trouble getting things to build due to missing 3rd-party package dependencies, read on to learn what to do. If you need help, see https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved#Getting_in_Touch_and_Working_Together.

== How to install the dependencies of one package ==
=== KDE neon, Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu ===
All the build packages known by the package you want to build can be installed by running:

<code>sudo apt build-dep <package you want to build></code>

For example, to install the build dependencies for Dolphin, run:

<code>sudo apt build-dep dolphin</code>

=== Fedora ===
If dependencies are missing for a specific RPM package, you can run:

<code>sudo dnf builddep <name_of_rpm_package></code>

For example, to install the build dependencies for Dolphin, run:

<code>sudo dnf builddep dolphin</code>

=== openSUSE ===
Generally you can install the required -devel packages that are needed to build some KDE software from source by using <code>zypper</code> (as root, or by using <code>sudo</code>), e.g. to install the -devel packages required to build dolphin from source:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# zypper --plus-content repo-source source-install --build-deps-only dolphin
</nowiki>}}

replace ''dolphin'' with some other package name, e.g. to build ''ktexteditor'' from source:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# zypper --plus-content repo-source source-install --build-deps-only ktexteditor
</nowiki>}}

Note that the <code>--plus-content</code> option in the above commands means you don't need to have the source repository enabled all the time, <code>--plus-content</code> will make zypper temporarily enable it to get the info it needs.

openSUSE (and most other RPM-based Linux distributions) support cmake() BuildRequires, which means you can install a development package like so:
{{Input|1=<nowiki>
# zypper install 'cmake(KF5KIO)'
</nowiki>}}

the part between the parenthesis ''KF5KIO'' is going to be in the error message that CMake will print in the terminal if you try to build something that requires e.g. KIO if KIO development headers aren't installed.

Any other dependencies can be figured out and installed as you continue building the modules one by one.

# 6. Page https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development

[[File:Mascot konqi-app-dev.png|right|x250px|]]
By joining the ranks of KDE developers, you will get to implement new features and defeat bugs both daunting and simple, all while collaborating to make coherent and stable releases. Developers collaborate in teams based on what area they are working in. These can be small teams working on a single application, up to large teams working on a group of related pieces of software. Many developers are in more than one team.

KDE runs or participates in several mentoring programs to help new developers, including an informal list of people who are willing to help newcomers get started. See the [[Mentoring]] page for more details.

== Prerequisites ==

=== Skills ===
Most KDE software is written in C++ using the [https://www.qt.io Qt toolkit] and [https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/ KDE Frameworks]. Though prior experience with these technologies or other programming languages is helpful, you don't need to be a C++ programmer to get started! For example, no programming knowledge whatsoever is required to do things like improve text labels.

If you'd like to dive deeper, the Qt wiki contains [https://wiki.qt.io/Books a list of online books] for learning Qt programming. Qt also provides [https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtexamplesandtutorials.html lots of examples] you can look at. For visual learners, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxyTkXLbcV4&list=PL6CJYn40gN6hdNC1IGQZfVI707dh9DPRc this YouTube playlist of QML tutorials] by KDE patron [https://www.kdab.com KDAB] may be useful. Finally, information about KDE Frameworks can be found on the [https://develop.kde.org/docs KDE Developer Platform] and [https://api.kde.org/ KDE API website]. Even more learning resources can be found [[Get_Involved/development/Learn|here]].

=== Operating system ===
For KDE development, we recommend a Linux operating system installed on your computer or in a [[/Developing_in_a_virtual_machine|virtual machine]]. Those that are best suited for development provide relatively recent versions of libraries needed by KDE software, and use the rolling-release model. Some examples are Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed, and KDE neon. The latest versions of Fedora KDE or Kubuntu can work as well.

Support for Windows and macOS is still experimental, and you may likewise have a better experience [[/Developing in a virtual machine|doing your development in a virtual machine using a Linux distribution]]. Setting up a development environment on [[/More#Other_operating_systems|other operating systems--including FreeBSD]]--is an advanced topic.

== Set up a development environment ==
If you don't have a KDE development environment set up, [[Get_Involved/development/Set_up_a_development_environment|learn how here]].

== Build software with kdesrc-build ==
Once you have a working development environment, learn how to [[Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build|use it to build various types of KDE software here]].

== Set up an integrated development environment ==
To make development process more convenient, you may want to use [[Get Involved/development/IDE configuration|IDE]]. This step is optional.

== Choose what to work on ==
A good place to start is with a small bug or feature in an existing piece of software that affects you personally ("scratch your own itch"). Get in touch with the existing developers (see [[#Communicate with the dev team|Communicate with the dev team]], below) and they can help you out, by pointing you to the right place in the code and giving advice about how to tackle the problem.

Try not to start by proposing or working on major features or significant design changes. These can be controversial, and the smoothest way to get going is by working on relatively non-controversial bugfixes. Start slowly and build trust!

Here are some other ideas for starting points:

* Improve awkwardly-worded messages and labels that are written in English. This is a great way for non-programmers to contribute! If you can compile software and have a good grasp of English, you can make a big difference here.
* Work on [https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&keywords=junior-jobs&list_id=1340815 Junior Jobs], which are small tasks that are suitable for beginners (both bugs and features).
* Work on [https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&keywords=usability&keywords_type=allwords&list_id=1493316&order=product%2Cchangeddate%20DESC%2Cbug_status%20DESC%2Cresolution%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&query_format=advanced Bugs related to] KDE's [[Goals/Usability_%26_Productivity | Usability & Productivity initiative]], many of which are small and easy.
* [[Get_Involved/development/Easy|More easy tasks]].

== Make your changes and test them ==
Once you've made some changes, make sure the project still compiles and installs, and make sure the changes have the desired effect when you run the software. Then it's time to run the project's test suite. For example, in KCalc:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
cd ~/kde/build/kcalc
source prefix.sh
ctest --output-on-failure
</nowiki>}}

If any test fails, that needs to be investigated and fixed before you can proceed. Once the tests pass, then run the software again to make sure it still behaves properly. If it doesn't, then go back and work on your patch some more, then re-compile and re-deploy, and test again, until the program does what you'd like it to do and all tests pass.

== Submitting changes for review ==
Once you're happy with a patch and have verified that it does what you want, it's time to submit your changes for the review!

KDE uses their own GitLab instance called [https://invent.kde.org Invent] for submitting merge requests and code review. See the [[Infrastructure/GitLab#Submitting_a_merge_request|GitLab page]] to learn how to submit a merge request.

== Communicate with the dev team ==
There are several ways to get in touch with KDE developers, either generally or for a specific project. The most important communications channels are:
* The [https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-devel:kde.org #kde-devel] channel on [[Matrix]] or the Libera Chat [[Internet Relay Chat | IRC]], which is where KDE developers chat in real-time about their work.
* The [https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-devel kde-devel mailing list] is the primary development mailing list. [http://kde.org/support/#mailinglists Learn more about mailing lists].

These are general KDE development communication channels, and you may get directed to a more appropriate place for the project you are interested in. There is a [http://www.kde.org/mailinglists/ list of mailing lists] if you want to find a mailing list for a specific team directly. Many teams have their own real-time chat channels, too.

You can also try looking for the team's section on the [[Main Page]] of this wiki. Many teams have information there for new contributors.

== Source code cross referencing ==
To search for a class, method, signal name... etc in all KDE repos, KDE uses a code referencing tool to index code in the various KDE repositories, you can search using the web interface available at https://lxr.kde.org/ . This is a very useful tool if you e.g. want to search for code usage examples in existing code... etc.

Usage:
* From the '''Branch group''' menu, you can select either '''kf5-qt5''', to search the code in the Git ''master'' branches or '''stable-kf5-qt5''' to search only the stable (released) branches
* There are two search ''modes'':
** On the '''Identifier search''' page, you can search for (note that this is case sensitive):
*** class names, e.g. ''RenameDialog'', ''StatJob'', and of course any Qt class (used in KDE code, which is pretty much all of them), ''QLatin1String'', ''QListWidget''
*** method names, e.g. ''addConfigSources()'' (from the KConfig framework) and signal names e.g. ''mimeTypeFound()''
** on the '''General search''' page, you can search for strings, e.g. in Dolphin's context menu (accessed by right- clicking any empty space) there is '''Paste Clipboard Contents''', if you want to find in which source file this string is defined, search for '''Paste Clipboard Contents'''; this search includes classes/methods/signals names.

Other ways to search across all of the KDE git repositories:
* If you have a github.com account. Log into github.com. Go to https://github.com/KDE , in the top left search bar, search for your search term e.g. <code>KMessageBox</code>, select "In this organization".
* <code>kdesrc-build --src-only</code> will download the source code of more than 300 KDE git repositories in <code>~/kde/src</code>. Search inside this directory. E.g. using Microsoft Visual Studio Code <code>code ~/kde/src</code>, from the vscode main menu > Edit > Find in Files Ctrl+Shift+F.

== Next steps ==
Sharpen your skills by going through the [https://develop.kde.org/docs/ KDE development tutorials].

After you have had several drama-free patches accepted, a KDE developer is likely to suggest you get a [[Infrastructure/Get a Developer Account|Developer account]], which will allow you to commit directly to KDE projects. With very few limits on where you can commit, you will be expected to act responsibly. At this point, congratulations! You are officially a KDE developer!

# https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Easy

Below are some easy ways to do merge requests (MR) for the KDE git repositories. And easy ways to contribute to the KDE Community.

You can find [[Get_Involved/development/IDE_configuration/Qt_Creator|here instructions on how to open a KDE git repository in the IDE Qt Creator]]. After you build that KDE git repository using kdesrc-build.

== You should be able to build all 400 KDE git repositories using kdesrc-build ==

From time to time, make sure that all the KDE git repositories (continue to) build correctly using kdesrc-build. Run:
kdesrc-build
without parameters. That will build all 400 KDE git repositories. If a KDE git repository was building successfully last week,
but does not build successfully today, invest time to investigate why it stopped building in a timeboxed manner. E.g. invest 10 minutes. Then, if needed, ask in the KDE Matrix room "KDE New Contributors" ( https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-welcome:kde.org ) if this module is supposed to build.

Example: let's say that kcalc does not build.
In konsole, I would run:

{{Input|1=<nowiki>
kdesrc-build kcalc --no-src --no-include-dependencies --refresh-build --debug |& tee ~/a.txt
</nowiki>}}

In the web browser create a pastebin. E.g. https://pastebin.centos.org/ Paste the contents of the file ~/a.txt.
Paste the URL of the new pastebin in the KDE matrix channel when requesting help.

== Spell check all GUI strings ==
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
The KDE git repos use GNU gettext and *.po files for translating the Graphical User Interface
elements such as buttons and menus.
Look through all of the KDE git repos, through all of the en*.po files
and make sure that there are no typos.

E.g. build all KDE git repos using kdesrc-build. Run:
kdesrc-build
without parameters.
In konsole:
cd ~/kde/src
grep --include=*.po -r msgid . | grep /en.*/ | sort -u | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z ]/ /g' | tr 'A-Z ' 'a-z\n' | grep '[a-z]' | sort -u | comm -23 - <(sort /usr/share/dict/words) > ~/GuiWordsNotInDictionary.txt
kate ~/GuiWordsNotInDictionary.txt

E.g. we find the probably wrong word "disactived".
In konsole:
cd ~/kde/src
code .
In VS Code:
Search for the word "disactived". Files to exclude "*.po".
There is just one single result:
~/kde/src/clementine/src/widgets/osd.cpp
line 251 "tr("Wii Remote %1: disactived")".
You edit file ~/kde/src/clementine/src/widgets/osd.cpp and replace:
disactived
with:
deactivated
With just this one line change in the source code, you do one git commit and one MR.
</pre>

== Just running kdesrc-build should not create "Unstaged Changes" in the local clone of a KDE git repo==
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
Build all the KDE git repositories using kdesrc-build. Run:
kdesrc-build
You should not see displayed the text:
* You had local changes to <ModuleName>, which have been re-applied.

In this case the issue is probably that the .gitignore file in the git repo is outdated.
E.g.
Install meld.
Let's say that kcalc is the git repo that reproduces this issue. You should have seen the text:
"* You had local changes to kcalc, which have been re-applied."
E.g. in ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc I have:
directory-layout invent
In konsole: I would run:
meld ~/kde/src/frameworks/kconfig/.gitignore ~/kde/src/utilities/kcalc/.gitignore
In the diff viewer I can see that the last two lines in the file
~/kde/src/frameworks/kconfig/.gitignore are new and do not exist yet in
~/kde/src/utilities/kcalc/.gitignore. I copy the new lines to ~/kde/src/utilities/kcalc/.gitignore
such that the two .gitignore files are identical.
Then I do a MR like https://invent.kde.org/graphics/kamera/-/merge_requests/5
</pre>

== C++ ==

=== Fix g++ C++ compiler warning ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
In konsole:
CXX=g++ kdesrc-build kcalc --debug |& tee ~/buildoutput_gxx.txt

Open the file ~/buildoutput.txt in a text editor. E.g. kate.
Search for the string "warning: ". It should appear tens of thousands of times.
Pick a build warning that seems simple enough to you. Invest time to fix one build warning.
Test that your fix is OK.
E.g. for kcalc built as shown above (i.e. in ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc I have: "directory-layout invent").
In konsole:
rm -rf ~/kde/build/utilities/kcalc
kdesrc-build kcalc --no-src --no-include-dependencies --debug
# Make sure there are no errors
cd ~/kde/build/utilities/kcalc
make test
# Make sure there are no errors

If everything is OK, fix a single g++ build warning,
do a single git commit and do a single MR.

Again, one MR should contain just one git commit.
And one git commit should contain only a single type of fixes (e.g. one type of fix),
with only handful of source code lines changed (e.g. only one line changed).

=== Fix clang++ C++ compiler warning ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
Do exactly as for g++ above.
Replace the first command line with:
CXX=clang++ kdesrc-build kcalc --debug |& tee ~/buildoutput_clangxx.txt

=== Fix clangd C++ compiler warning ===

=== Fix Clang-Tidy static analysis issue ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">

=== Fix Cppcheck static analysis issue ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OYvQ4Mi_1I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TSeSVDI3_s

Qt Creator has a plugin for cppcheck.
Build a KDE git repository using kdesrc-build. Open it in the IDE Qt Creator.
From Qt Creator main menu > Help > About Plugins > Code Analyzer > enable Cppcheck (experimental).
Restart Qt Creator. From Qt Creator main menu > Analyze > Cppcheck... > make sure that the content of the edit box "Custom arguments:" is "--inline-suppr" > press the Analyze button.

If the developer wants, the developer can disable the cppcheck warning for a source code line.
The man page for cppcheck says "--inline-suppr
Enable inline suppressions. Use them by placing comments in the form:
// cppcheck-suppress <CppcheckErrorID>
before the line to suppress.".

E.g. in the application kalk:
// cppcheck-suppress duplicateExpression
KNumber::NegInfinity / KNumber::NegInfinity,
Disables the cppcheck warning "kalk/knumber/tests/knumbertest.cpp:678: Same expression on both sides of '/'.".

After you have fixed all of the cppcheck warnings that you can. After you have suppressed in source code using comments all the cppcheck warnings that the developer wants to be suppressed. Create a cppcheck command line that returns success (exit status zero). And do a Merge Request such that the Continuous Integration (CI) will make sure that cppcheck returns success. E.g. https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/kalk/-/merge_requests/43

=== Fix static analysis issue using Allen Winter's krazy ===

<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
Install krazy:

# Read https://github.com/Krazy-collection/krazy/blob/master/Install.txt
# Set up kdesrc-build using the kdesrc-build setup procedure.
kdesrc-build frameworks

mkdir -p ~/kde/misc && cd ~/kde/misc
git clone https://github.com/Krazy-collection/krazy.git
cd krazy
# Install the packages mentioned in chapter "Requirements" of https://github.com/Krazy-collection/krazy/blob/master/Install.txt . E.g.:
# sudo apt install libjson-perl libyaml-perl

# If you have installed Qt using kdesrc-build, prepend ~/kde/usr to some environment variables. E.g.:
# source ~/kde/build/kconfig/prefix.sh
./install.sh ~/kde/usr
source ~/kde/build/kconfig/prefix.sh
which krazy2
# Should say: ~/kde/usr/bin/krazy2
# Read the help:
krazy2 --help
# Test
krazy2 ~/kde/src/kconfig/src/core/*.{cpp,h}

Build a KDE git repository using kdesrc-build. Run krazy on the source code files of that KDE git repository:

kdesrc-build kconfig
krazy2 --brief --check-sets c++,qt5,kde5,foss --explain ~/kde/src/kconfig/src/core/*.{cpp,h}
# Says:
#Check for spelling errors [spelling]... 2 issues found

#        ~/kde/src/kconfig/src/core/kcoreconfigskeleton.h: line#805[for for] (1)

# The qt5 and kde5 check-sets also work for Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6.

# Go over all of the source code files.
find ~/kde/src -type f -name "*.cpp" -print -exec bash -c  'echo "{}"; krazy2 --brief --check-sets c++,qt5,kde5,foss --explain "{}" ' \; |& tee ~/a.txt
</pre>

=== Use the new Qt signal slot syntax ===

https://wiki.qt.io/New_Signal_Slot_Syntax

== Fix deprecation issue ==

E.g. kDebug, kWarning and other symbols from ~/kde/usr/include/KF5/KDELibs4Support/kdebug.h are deprecated. Replace with e.g. the symbols in the family of qDebug from ~/kde/usr/include/QtCore/qlogging.h and ~/kde/usr/include/QtCore/qdebug.h .

E.g. run kdesrc-build without parameters, this will git clone and build all KDE git repositories. Search in ~/kde/src (i.e. in all the KDE git repositories) using e.g. VS Code for a deprecated symbol. You find an affected source code file in the git repository X. Open that git repository correctly in Qt Creator. Make sure that the deprecated symbol really is the one you thought it is. Replace the deprecated symbol. Build, test, git commit, MR.

== QML ==

=== qmllint ===

<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
# Get the source code of all of the KDE git repositories using kdesrc-build:
kdesrc-build --src-only
cd ~/kde/src
# As per https://www.kdab.com/kdab-contributions-qt-5-4-qmllint/
find . -type f -name "*.qml" -exec qmllint \{\} +
# Make sure that the list of warnings returned today is not longer than the list of warnings returned in a previous day.
</pre>

Note: Once the qmllint installed from you Linux distribution's packages has the feature "You can now ignore individual warnings by adding "// qmllint disable" in the line causing it. You may also specify one or more warning type to ignore ("// qmllint disable warningtype1 warningtype2...") which is preferable. This can also be done for entire blocks of code by using "// qmllint disable" in an empty line and ending it with "// qmllint enable"" https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdeclarative/+/351372/6 . Then we will be able to add comments in the "*.qml" files that have qmllint warnings. The end goal is that running qmllint on all of the "*.qml" files from all of the KDE git repositories should not show any qmllint warnings.

=== qmlscene ===

<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
# This is an advanced topic.
# Get the source code of all of the KDE git repositories using kdesrc-build:

kate ~/a.txt &
# For now, ignore the errors of type:
# module "X" is not installed
# ReferenceError: Y is not defined
# Make sure that the list of warnings returned today is not longer than the list of warnings returned in a previous day.
</pre>

== CMake ==

=== cmakelint ===

Install https://github.com/cmake-lint/cmake-lint .

Set up kdesrc-build. Choose a KDE git repository, e.g. kconfig.

<pre>
kdesrc-build kconfig
cd ~/kde/src/kconfig
for i in `find . -type f -name "CMakeLists.txt"`; do cmakelint "$i"; done &> ~/a.txt
kate ~/a.txt &

for i in `find . -type f -name "*.cmake"`; do cmakelint "$i"; done &> ~/b.txt
kate ~/b.txt &
</pre>

=== Call the cmake_minimum_required() command at the beginning of the top-level CMakeLists.txt file ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
* https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html :
"Note Call the cmake_minimum_required() command at the beginning of the
top-level CMakeLists.txt file even before calling the project() command.
It is important to establish version and policy settings before invoking
other commands whose behavior they may affect. See also policy CMP0000."

Find an affected KDE git repo where in the top level CMakeLists.txt before
cmake_minimum_required() exist non empty lines, no comment lines,
but lines that contain CMake source code.
Do a MR like https://invent.kde.org/graphics/kolourpaint/-/merge_requests/23

Example:
I install Microsoft Visual Studio Code and I make sure that "code" is in $PATH.
I build all KDE git repos:
kdesrc-build
without parameters.
In ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc I have:
directory-layout invent
In konsole:
cd ~/kde/src
code . # This will start VS Code.
In VS Code main menu > View > Search Ctrl+Shift+F. In the Search field write:
cmake_minimum_required
in the field "files to include" write:
CMakeLists.txt
Press F4 one hundred times. It will go through all of the lines that contain
"cmake_minimum_required" in all of the files named "CMakeLists.txt".
You probably do not want to edit the CMakeLists.txt file from subdirectories named
like 3rdparty. These directories are a non KDE project, which has its upstream
git repo outside invent.kde.org. Fix the issues in third party libraries in their
upstream git repo.
</pre>

== KDE wiki ==
You should probably not edit old or archived wiki pages. E.g. https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Applications/17.04_Feature_Plan Do not edit wiki pages about an event from 10 years ago, e.g. https://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Meetings/Osnabrueck_4. Do not edit wiki pages about old technologies e.g. maemo, QtWebKit, KDE 4, Qt4, QBS etc.

=== Spell check and grammar check a random KDE wiki page ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
E.g.
Create a new Google Doc named “SpellCheck”.
In the web browser:
https://community.kde.org/index.php?title=Special:Random
takes you to:
https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved Ctrl+A Ctrl+C.

In the Google Doc: Ctrl+Shift+V. From the Google Doc main menu > Tools >
Spelling and grammar > Spelling and grammar check. It says that we should replace:
"KDE's Quality Assurance team tests pre-release software and proposed changed to make sure that everything works properly!"
with:
"KDE's Quality Assurance team tests pre-release software and proposes changes to make sure that everything works properly!"
In the web browser: edit the KDE wiki page to fix the spelling or grammar error.
</pre>

=== In a random KDE wiki page, URL links should work correctly ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
E.g.
In the web browser:
https://community.kde.org/index.php?title=Special:Random
takes you to:
https://community.kde.org/Incubator/Projects/Rkward
you click on the URL:
"Its features can be extended by plugins, and it's all free software (Above information from
the current Rkward homepage." http://rkward.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page
This takes you to:
https://rkward.kde.org/Main_Page
which is a web page that does not exist.

Edit the KDE wiki such that you replace the invalid URL
"http://rkward.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page" with a valid URL.
Which in this case is the canonical homepage of the project rkward.
I.e. https://apps.kde.org/rkward/ .
This URL is probably better than the other possibility: https://rkward.kde.org/ .
</pre>

=== In a random KDE wiki page, the wiki markup should be correct ===
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
Learn wikipedia/mediawiki wiki markup syntax. E.g. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting , https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Cheatsheet

E.g.
In the web browser:
https://community.kde.org/index.php?title=Special:Random
takes you to:
https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Bug_triaging
You should be logged in. You edit the page (in the left hand side of the page Actions > Edit).

You see that "=" is used instead of "==". https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting says "Section formatting – only at the beginning of the line ... == Level 2 == ... Skip Level 1, it is page name level.". So you replace all "=" with "==". Make sure that the Table of Contents stays the same.
E.g. https://community.kde.org/index.php?title=Guidelines_and_HOWTOs%2FBug_triaging&type=revision&diff=95496&oldid=95495

== KDE Craft ==
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
Besides kdesrc-build. KDE has another tool that can build KDE git repos: KDE Craft.
https://community.kde.org/Craft

E.g. choose a KDE git repo. E.g. kcalc.
Choose one of the operating systems supported by KDE Craft.
One of Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux or FreeBSD. E.g. Linux.
Create a Linux VM, install KDE Craft in this VM.
In konsole:
craft kcalc
Run the newly built/downloaded and installed kcalc.
</pre>

== Run executable using a run time analyzer ==
<pre  style="white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal;">
This is neither easy, nor suitable for beginners.

Build a KDE git repo that is not a framework or a library.
I.e. build a KDE app.
Make sure that you have kdesrc-build configured to build using
CMake build configuration "Debug".
I.e. in ~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc I have:
cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

E.g. build kcalc:
In konsole:
kdesrc-build kcalc
Then run kcalc under valgrind.

If valgrind says that there is an issue.
And if the issue is not in Mesa or in Qt.
But the issue is in one of the KDE git repos, e.g. a memory leak.
valgrind will say the line where the leak occurs.
</pre>
