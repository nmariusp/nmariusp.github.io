# How to install using the Qt online installer from https://www.qt.io

<pre>
Kubuntu 23.04
I terraformed the OS to my liking: I install the RDP server xrdp https://nmariusp.github.io/how-to-install-xrdp.html# . I installed meld, mc, krusader, emacs-nox, openssh-server, git, gitk, git-gui.
I installed Qt Creator and Qt 6.4.3 from qt.io website using the online installer
Hundreds of deb files were missing. E.g. build-essential g++ libvulkan-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglx-dev libopengl-dev libxcb-glx0-dev cmake gcc autoconf automake
Inside Qt Creator, I have created the default QML app project. I have loaded and run some QML example projects from the Welcome page.

cd <WorkDirectory>
export PATH=/home/administrator/Qt/6.4.3/gcc_64/bin:$PATH
qml hello.qml

I have built and installed KDAB GammaRay as /home/administrator/.local/bin/gammaray.
