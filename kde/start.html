# Introduction

This document is for you if you want to start programming for the KDE Community. Bonus points if you are actually **committing** to program for KDE for a couple hours per week, each week, for years.

This document contains **what I (nmariusp) would do if I would start programming for KDE again**.

There is no particular order in which you should follow the three parallel tracks. E.g. you can set up kdesrc-build first and only after that you create the needed online accounts, while in parallel learning by watching YouTube videos. You will continue to be learning for a long time after you complete the procedure "Start programming for KDE" presented in this handbook.

# How to watch my youtube videos

My youtube screen recordings are 1080p so you should watch them on your computer not on your phone because my fonts will be too small.

You should download the youtube video on your computer in 720p. Reasons: smaller download, you cause less cost to youtube because no matter how many times you rewatch or you scroll through the video, the bits are downloaded only once.

And watch it in a good video player e.g. smplayer, mpv, vlc. Reasons: Better quality (think quality upscaling from 720p, also, the youtube.com player sometimes displays the video in less than 720p because of networking reasons). You can resize the video player window as you want. You can hide the main menu/toolbar (in smplayer this is "Video > Compact mode Ctrl+C").

You should have at least 1080p resolution 100% DPI and you should be able to read your fonts; or equivalent. E.g. I have a 32" VA monitor, 1440p, 100% DPI, 60Hz.
We will call the right half of the screen "doc" (i.e. documentation), and the left half of the screen "work".

In order for the future you to remember a youtube video of mine, you should do whatever I do in the youtube video.
Open the youtube video in your video player, make it use the entire right half of the screen ("doc") (in KDE Plasma, use the shortcut "Windows key" on your keyboard + "Right arrow" key on your keyboard (Win+Right Arrow)).
Use the left half of the screen ("work") for reproducing whatever I do. If I open a terminal (e.g. KDE Konsole), then open that. If I type in something, type that. If I install and configure an orthodox file manager (e.g. Krusader), do that. If I create an account on the Qt Framework website, do that. You cannot paste anything, so you will learn by typing a lot using the keyboard.
Pause and resume the video player often (e.g. with the key "Space" in smplayer or mpv).

Please learn the most important keyboard shortcuts of your video player. E.g. for smplayer: Space = Play/Pause, Up Arrow/Down Arrow/Left Arrow/Right Arrow/Page Up/Page Down = scroll through the video, M = mute, F = fullscreen, O (the letter "o") multiple times = various levels of On Screen Display (OSD).

The command line for downloading is:

yt-dlp -f 22 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_X1qB061r4

You can search through my youtube screen recordings using a URL like https://www.youtube.com/@nmariusp/search?query=kdesrc-build
My youtube videos have the month in the video name. If I have more screen recordings about the same topic, then the video with the newer month in the video name will be more up to date.

# nmariusp's algorithm "Start programming for KDE"

Three of the chapters described below can be done in parallel. There is no dependency between each other:  
`1.` Parallel track one: Online accounts  
`2.` Parallel track two: Be able to build all 400 KDE git repositories  
`3.` Parallel track three: Learn Linux, C++, Qt, KDE source code https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Learn  

`Step 0.` Can you program? Do you know at least a bit of Python programming? A bit of bash programming (did you use procedures and loops)? Any other programming language?

If NO then goto END. I (nmariusp) cannot help, sorry.

The entrypoint to starting to program for KDE is https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development
My youtube screen recording: “Start programming for KDE tutorial for beginners”.

`Step 1.` Create online accounts.

Example: If your name is "Walter John G. Mayberry". "Walter" and "John" are your first names. Your preferred first name is "Walter", not "John". You would want people from the KDE community to call you "Walter".

You create a Gmail account jwaltergm@gmail.com. This is the email address that you use for "open source contributions and KDE contributions". I.e. the gmail email account should contain your entire preferred first name ("walter") and initials from other parts of your name. This way: the gmail email address is available and you can use "jwaltergm" as an account on many other websites.

Using this email account you create an account on bugs.kde.org, an account on https://www.qt.io/ (in order to download the latest version of the IDE Qt Creator).

You create an account named jwaltergm in https://identity.kde.org and in matrix.org. Using your https://identity.kde.org account log into invent.kde.org, set up two factor authentication (2FA) e.g. Google Authenticator, create SSH keys.

On matrix, join the "KDE Community space" https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-community:kde.org , "KDE New Contributors" https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-welcome:kde.org and "KDE Development" https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-devel:kde.org . As a matrix client, you can use the web browser.

Some other accounts that you might want to have: jwaltergm@gmail.com on reddit.com (join "/r/kde"), join the mailing list kde-devel https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-devel, jwaltergm@gmail.com on github.com

`Step 2.` Learn UNIX/Linux/bash, git. Learn the C programming language (including the hard parts, i.e. pointers). Learn the C++ programming language. Learn the Qt framework, learn Qt QML, learn the KDE Frameworks (KF). Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)
I have more than 11 youtube screen recordings for this. E.g. "UNIX command line tutorial", "Book speedrun: Thinking in C by Bruce Eckel".

`Step 3.` Get hardware.

You will be compiling tens or hundreds of KDE git repositories. The source code will be mostly C++. Compiling C++ benefits from better hardware.

If I buy better hardware then I do not lose time.

You will run the Linux operating system (OS) either on your hardware machine or in a VM. The CPU architecture should be x86_64 (amd64). I would not use a computer with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon , because running a x86_64 Linux VM would be slow for me. You can connect e.g. via RDP protocol to a computer that has better hardware.

I recommend good hardware, this would be a minimum: The CPU has hardware assisted virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). SSD not HDD. You can allocate on the SSD at least 250 GB of space to a Linux VM or a Linux partition. At least 8 GB RAM if you will not use Virtual Machines (VMs), i.e. you will run the Linux OS on your hardware computer. At least 8 CPU threads (vcpus) for the Linux VM.

Hardware pain points: nvidia GPU, laptop with GPU switching/hybrid graphics, hardware that requires "out of tree" Linux driver kernel modules, monitors with high DPI/high refresh rate/high color and other hardware that is not well supported by the "upstream" Linux kernel and by the rest of the software infrastructure in a Linux OS.

I cannot help you if you do not have enough hardware.

`Step 4.` Install on a hardware computer or in a Virtual Machine (VM) a Linux OS that is better supported by kdesrc-build.

The list is: rolling-release Linux distributions (Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed, KDE neon) or the latest version of Fedora KDE Spin.
I have more than 12 youtube screen recordings for this. E.g. "openSUSE Tumbleweed VM and kdesrc-build tutorial".

If you have the Windows OS installed on your hardware computer, I would upgrade to Windows Pro from Windows Home. And I would install the Linux OS in a Hyper-V VM. E.g. https://www.youtube.com/@nmariusp/search?query=windows , the newer screen recordings will be more up to date.

`Step 5.` Set up kdesrc-build.

KDE has more than 400 git repositories. In order to build the KDE git repositories correctly and in the correct order, we use the build framework kdesrc-build.

The procedure "How to install kdesrc-build" is https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development
I have more than 20 youtube screen recordings for this. E.g. https://www.youtube.com/@nmariusp/search?query=kdesrc-build , the newer screen recordings will be more up to date.

`Step 6.` Learn the Integrated Development Environment Qt Creator.

Learn how to use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) [Qt Creator](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/IDE_configuration/Qt_Creator) as well as possible and use it for at least two weeks. After that, if you want, you can switch to another IDE or C++ text editor.

And after that, optionally, you can learn how to use other IDEs and text editors.
I have more than 21 youtube screen recordings for this. E.g. "How to install Qt Creator from the Qt Framework website".

`Step 7.` Choose what to do.

https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development#Choose_what_to_work_on
https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Easy
I have more than 16 youtube screen recordings for this. E.g. "Easy KDE contribution fix clang, clazy, cppcheck issues inside Qt Creator", "What to do after a module builds with kdesrc-build".

`Step 8.` Create a Merge Request (MR) for a KDE git repository.

https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab#Submitting_a_merge_request
I have more than 3 youtube screen recordings for this. E.g. "What to do after a module builds with kdesrc-build".

# Advanced topics

The IDE [JetBrains CLion](clion.html).

Learn the rest of the pyramid of things that people who program for KDE will learn: Linux, UNIX, command line, git, gitk, git gui, GitLab, the English language, the C programming language, C++, virtual machines (QEMU, virt-manager, Oracle VirtualBox, Microsoft Windows Hyper-V), Linux containers (docker, distrobox, podman, lxc, lxd), app technologies (Ubuntu snap, flatpak, AppImage, AppStream, xdg, REUSE), Qt framework, wayland, X11 etc.
